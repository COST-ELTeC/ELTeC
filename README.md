# ELTeC

## General remarks 

This is the umbrella repository that references the collections contained in any given release of ELTeC (European Literary Text Collection), a collection of novels in multiple European languages created by the COST Action *Distant Reading for European Literary History* (CA16204). 

ELTeC aims to provide multiple collections of 100 novels published between 1840 and 1920 in their original language. There are collections for multiple European languages, but the novels included in them are not translations of each other. Each collection follows the same criteria for corpus composition, but these criteria allow for some flexibility in corpus composition. The novels are encoded in a common manner according to a specific subset of the Guidelines of the *Text Encoding Initiative*. More detailed information on ELTeC can be found in the following places: 

* ELTeC is described succinctly here: https://www.distant-reading.net/eltec/. 
* An overview of the current state in ELTeC corpus building can be found here: https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/
* Work on the ELTeC collections is in progress here: https://github.com/COST-ELTeC
* The criteria used for corpus composition can be found here: https://distantreading.github.io/sampling_proposal.html
* The encoding guidelines used for the XML-TEI markup (level 1) can be found here: https://distantreading.github.io/Schema/eltec-1.html 
* The schemas used to validate the XML-TEI files can be found here (and are included in each release): https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/Schemas 

The concept DOI, covering all releases of this umbrella repository and always resolving to the latest release, is the following: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3462435.

## Release notes, v0.X.0 

ELTeC is work in progress and the current release reflects this. We aim at 100 novels per language collection, but the current release includes any collection containing more than 20 novels. Also, there are still improvements to be made, in some cases, to the encoding of the texts and/or to the quality of the transcriptions. 

Generally speaking, the texts included in the current release are encoded either on a level 0 or level 1 encoding, according to the ELTeC scheme of levels of encoding. Please also take note of the README files included with each collection's release linked below. They describe the current state of each collection.
